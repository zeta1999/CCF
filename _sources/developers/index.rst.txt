Writing CCF Applications
========================

This section describes how CCF applications can be developed and deployed to a CCF network.

Applications can be written in C++ or Lua (see :ref:`developers/example:Example Application`). An application consists of a collection of endpoints that can be triggered by :term:`users`. Each endpoint can define an :ref:`developers/logging_cpp:API Schema` to validate user requests.

These endpoints mutate the state of a unique :ref:`developers/kv/index:Key-Value Store` that represents the internal state of the application. Applications define a set of ``Maps`` (see :ref:`developers/kv/kv_how_to:Creating a Map`), mapping from a key to a value. When an application endpoint is triggered, the effects on the Store are committed atomically.
